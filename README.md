# Hangman Game

Welcome to my Hangman game project, hosted at [vatsalmodgil.pythonanywhere.com](http://vatsalmodgil.pythonanywhere.com)! This project is a personal endeavor to demonstrate my abilities with Python and the Flask web framework. Players are challenged to guess letters to form a word before their hangman gets fully drawn.

## Features

- **Dynamic Word Selection**: The game selects a new word randomly from a predefined list, providing a fresh challenge each time.
- **Graphical Hangman Representation**: Watch as your hangman is drawn piece by piece with each incorrect guess.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Immediate Game Restart**: Easily start a new game once the current game ends, regardless of win or loss.

## Live Demo
