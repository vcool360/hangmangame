# Hangman Game

Welcome to my Hangman game project! This is a personal project I developed to sharpen my Python skills and get more familiar with web development using Flask. The game is simple but engaging: players guess letters to form a word before their hangman gets drawn completely.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Each game picks a new word randomly from a curated list, making each playthrough unique.
- **Graphical Hangman**: Enjoy seeing the hangman drawn step by step as incorrect guesses are made.
- **Responsive Design**: Play comfortably on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Game Restart Capability**: Easily start a new game once the current one ends, whether you win or lose.
